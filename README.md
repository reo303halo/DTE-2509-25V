### **Prerequisites**
Before starting the course, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Flask** (`pip install flask`)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **A code editor** (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text)

### **Setting Up Your Development Environment**
1. Clone the course repository (if applicable):
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - Windows:
     ```sh
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask server:
